# react-prayer-times

This is a simple component that takes the prayer times as props and outputs a table with the prayer times.

An example usage:

```
<PrayerTimes 
        fajr='6:00 AM'
        dhuhr='12:30 PM'
        asr='3:30 PM'
        maghrib='5:37 PM'
        isha='8:00 PM'
        jumuah='1:20 PM'
    />
```

## To Do

- Build the same component for other libraries (svelte, vue.js, etc).
- Work with an API to be able to pass a zipcode and automatically populate the prayer times.
- Other possibilities
